Using the simple code, you can conduct sequence permutation easily.
Firstly, please make sure that python was installed in your computer correctly.
For sequence permutation, a fasta file contained peptide sequences is needed.
When using the simple sequence permutation code, just input the following command:
Python random_seq.py sequences_needed_to_be_permutated.fasta output.fasta
